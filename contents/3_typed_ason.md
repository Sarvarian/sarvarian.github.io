## [0] What Is Typed ASON

Typed ASON is a collection of
specifications in addition to
the original ASON specification
for parsers to infer data type
of ASON nodes.

Parsers are NOT obligated to
implement all of these. Parser
authors can pick and choose.

## [1] 3 Ways of Specifying Types

First, neighboring nodes.

Second, annotated string.

Third, numeric feature.
