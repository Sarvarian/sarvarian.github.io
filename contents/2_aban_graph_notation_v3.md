# Aban Graph Notation

## [0] What is AGN

It is a basis for all languages
under aban language family.

It describes the syntax of most
if not all aban languages.

AGN is all about syntax, a simple syntax
that you can use to describe a graph in
a text file.

AGN is NOT concern with semantics in any
shape or form, only syntax.

## [1] Variations

Aban languages, sometimes called
'Variations', sometimes 'Editions'.

AGN is the base syntax of most, if not
all, aban languages.

Variations define semantics for
information presented in aban documents.

## [2] Documents

A computer file can contain one or more
aban documents.

Each document possibly contain three
meta pieces plus its main content.

The four documents pieces are in order:

First, Document Character Encoding
Directive, or CED for short.

Second, Document Purpose Directive, or
just Purpose is context is clear.

Third, came the main content, that we
will talk about later.

Forth, Document Terminator, that signals
end of a document and possibly start of
a new document in the same file.
