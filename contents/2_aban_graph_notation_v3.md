# Aban Graph Notation

## [0] What is AGN

AGN is a simple syntax that is basis for
most of, if not all, aban languages.

## [1] Variations

Aban languages, sometimes called
'Variation', sometimes 'Editions'.

These variations define semantics.

## [2] Documents

A computer file can contain one or more
aban documents.

Each document possibly contain three
meta pieces plus its main content.

The four documents pieces are in order:

First, Document Character Encoding
Directive, or CED for short.

Second, Document Purpose Directive, or
just Purpose is context is clear.

Third, came the main content, that we
will talk about later.

Forth, Document Terminator, that signals
end of a document and possibly start of
a new document in the same file.
